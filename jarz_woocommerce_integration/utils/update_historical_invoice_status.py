"""Update existing historical invoices with custom acceptance status and sales invoice state.

This script updates all existing Sales Invoices created from WooCommerce orders
to set the custom fields based on their original WooCommerce status:

- Completed orders: custom_acceptance_status = "Accepted", custom_sales_invoice_state = "Delivered"
- Cancelled/Refunded orders: custom_acceptance_status = "Accepted", custom_sales_invoice_state = "Cancelled"
