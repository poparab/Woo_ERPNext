# Customer Territory Assignment - Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented automatic territory assignment for WooCommerce customers based on their delivery zones.

## Results

### Before
- **3 customers (0.3%)** had territories assigned
- 1,016 customers without territories (no POS Profile inheritance)

### After
- **902 customers (88.5%)** now have territories assigned
- 117 customers without territories (97 have no address, 20 have unmapped zones)
- All customers with territories inherit POS Profiles automatically

## Implementation

### 1. Territory Resolution Logic (`customer_sync.py`)

Added `_resolve_territory_from_state()` function that:
- Maps WooCommerce state field (e.g., "Nasr City - Ù…Ø¯ÙŠÙ†Ù‡ Ù†ØµØ±") to ERPNext Territory codes (e.g., "EGNASRCITY")
- Uses reverse mapping from `territory_sync.CODE_TO_DISPLAY`
- Handles both English and Arabic delivery zone names
- Falls back to case-insensitive matching

### 2. Automatic Assignment During Order Sync

Modified `ensure_customer_with_addresses()` to:
- Extract delivery zone from shipping/billing address state field
- Resolve territory using `_resolve_territory_from_state()`
- Automatically assign territory to customer during order processing
- Update territory if different from current value

### 3. Bulk Update Utility (`update_customer_territories.py`)

Created `update_customer_territories_from_addresses_cli()` to:
- Scan all existing customers in ERPNext
- Read their shipping/billing addresses
- Extract state fields and resolve territories
- Bulk update customer territories
- Results: 584 updated, 316 already correct, 97 no address, 22 no match

## Territory Distribution

Top territories by customer count:
1. EGHADAYEQAH (Hadayek Al-Ahram): 100 customers
2. EG6OCT (6 October): 76 customers
3. EGNASRCITY (Nasr City): 69 customers
4. EGISM (Ismailia): 68 customers
5. EGMAADI (Maadi): 54 customers
6. EGTAGAMMO (Settlement): 49 customers
7. EGFAYSAL (Faisal): 48 customers
8. EGHARAM (Haram): 44 customers
9. EGZAYED (Sheikh Zayed): 41 customers
10. EGGIZA (Giza): 37 customers

## POS Profile Coverage

- **36 territories** have POS Profiles configured (typically "Ahram Gardens")
- **4 territories** without POS Profiles (likely parent territories)
- Customers in territories with POS Profiles automatically inherit:
  - Warehouse assignment
  - Price list
  - Payment methods
  - Company defaults

## Usage

### For New Customers/Orders
Territory assignment happens automatically during:
- Order sync (historical and live)
- Customer sync from WooCommerce
- Webhook processing

### For Existing Customers

```bash
bench --site <site> execute jarz_woocommerce_integration.utils.update_customer_territories.update_customer_territories_from_addresses_cli
```

### Check Territory Distribution
```bash
bench --site <site> execute jarz_woocommerce_integration.utils.check_territories.check_customer_territories_cli

- These customers can be manually assigned territories or will be updated when they place new orders with valid delivery zones
- Territory codes use format: EG + location code (e.g., EGNASRCITY, EG6OCT)
- Display names include English + Arabic (e.g., "Nasr City - Ù…Ø¯ÙŠÙ†Ù‡ Ù†ØµØ±")
